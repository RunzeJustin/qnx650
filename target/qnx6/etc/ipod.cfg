# protocol values may be specified. It has been noted that at the time of
# release that data packets sent to an EAF application on the iPhone are lost
# if they are too large. The maxsendsize option below must be used to force the
# iPod driver to send the data in smaller chunks, the current generation of
# iPhone OS devices have a limit to their maximum input buffer size. The
# maxrecvbuf option below can be used to limit how much data the iPod driver
# will buffer for a session. The autolaunchID is the appID that the iPod driver
# asks the iPod to launch (if supported) when the iPod driver finishes the IDPS
# exchange. The eafmd option allows how applications are matched.

# EmptyPlayback3rdPartyApp option (default disabled) to report the iPod in a stopped

# EnterVideoBeforeAUdio option (default disabled) is to workaround a firmware issue

# SkipGetiPodOptionsForLingo option (default disabled) is to workaround a firmware issue
# with Touch/iPhone 1G firmware 1.1.5. This avoids sending GetiPodOptionsForLingo which
# causes problems on the Touch/iPhone 1G.  This will break certification for all
