#ifdef T2K_DOCUMENTATION
-------------------------

Q&A Section:

Q1) What files do I need to look at?
A1) First you need to familiarize yourself with this file "T2K.H"."T2K.H" contains
	documentation, a coding example and the actual T2K API.
	Second you need to look at "CONFIG.H". "CONFIG.H" is the only file you normally
	need to edit. The file configures T2K for your platform, and it enables
	or disables optional features, and it allows you to build debug or non-debug versions.
	The file itself contains more information. Turn off features you do not need in order
	to minimize the size of the T2K font engine.
-------------------------
Q2) What is the basic principle for the usage of T2K API?
A2) The basic idea is that T2K was designed to be object oriented, even though the
	actual implementation is only using ANSI C. This means that you will be creating
	a number of objects when you use T2K. All classes have a constructor and destructor.
	It is important that you call the proper destructor when you are done with a particular
	object.
-------------------------
Q3) What is the best way of getting T2K going on a new platform?
A3) It is best to first configure "CONFIG.H" and then look at the
	coding example below at T2K_DOCUMENTATION_CODING_EXAMPLE.
	We recommend that you start "outside in".

First create and destroy a "Memhandler" object:
(This is the "outermost" object.)

	tsiMemObject *mem = NULL;

	mem = tsi_NewMemhandler( &errCode );
	CLIENT_ASSERT( errCode == 0 );

	/* Destroy the Memhandler object. */
	tsi_DeleteMemhandler( mem );

Next create an InputStream object.

	tsiMemObject *mem = NULL;
	InputStream *in = NULL;

	mem = tsi_NewMemhandler( &errCode );
	CLIENT_ASSERT( errCode == 0 );

		/* otherwise do this if you allocated the data */
		in = New_InputStream3( mem, data1, size1, &errCode );
		CLIENT_ASSERT( errCode == 0 );

		/* Destroy the InputStream object. */
		Delete_InputStream( in, &errCode  );

	/* Destroy the Memhandler object. */
	tsi_DeleteMemhandler( mem );

Next you would create the "sfntClass" object and then finally the "T2K" scaler object.
-------------------------
Q4) Ok, then what do I do with the T2K scaler object?
A4) First you need to set the "transformation" with the
	T2K_NewTransformation() call/method. Basically you specify the
	pointsize, x and y resolution, and a 2*2 transformation matrix,
	and true/false for if you want embedded bitmaps to be enabled.

	Then you call T2K_RenderGlyph() to actually get bitmap and/or outline data.
	After you are done with the output data you need to call T2K_PurgeMemory to
	free up memory.
-------------------------
Q5) So I call T2K_RenderGlyph(), but where do I get access to the bitmap data?
A5) You get access to the bitmap data through public fields in the T2K class/structure.
	Find the following fields:
	/* Begin bitmap data */
	long width, height;
	F26Dot6 fTop26Dot6, fLeft26Dot6;
	long rowBytes;
	unsigned char *baseAddr; /* unsigned char baseAddr[N], 	N = t->rowBytes * t->height */
	uint32 *baseARGB;
	/* End bitmap data */

	baseAddr is either a bit-array, or a byte array.
	baseARGB is a 32 bit array (ARGB) used for color bitmaps.
-------------------------
Q6) Can you give me a simple/naive example of how to actually draw a character?
A6) Ok, something like this should work:
/*
 *	Slow naive example on how to get bitmap data from the T2K scaler object.
 *  The example assumes a screen-coordinate system where the top leftmost position on the screen is 0,0.

Q7) How do I draw a string with the above MyDrawCharExample()?
A7)

	F16Dot16 x, y;
	x = y = 12 << 16;

	while (characters to draw..)
		/* Render the character */
		T2K_RenderGlyph( scaler, charCode, 0, 0,
						 GREY_SCALE_BITMAP_HIGH_QUALITY,
						 T2K_SCAN_CONVERT, &errCode );
		CLIENT_ASSERT( errCode == 0 );
		/* Now draw the character */
		MyDrawCharExample( scaler, ((x + 0x8000)>> 16) + (scaler->fLeft26Dot6 >> 6),
								   ((y + 0x8000)>> 16) - (scaler->fTop26Dot6 >>6) );
		x += scaler->xAdvanceWidth16Dot16;	/* advance the pen forward */
		/* Free up memory */
		T2K_PurgeMemory( scaler, 1, &errCode );
		CLIENT_ASSERT( errCode == 0 );
	}
-------------------------
Q8) How do I get grey-scale or monochrome output?
A8) For monochrome output set 5th input parameter to T2K_RenderGlyph called greyScaleLevel equal to BLACK_AND_WHITE_BITMAP.
	To get grey-scale output set 5th input parameter to T2K_RenderGlyph called greyScaleLevel equal to GREY_SCALE_BITMAP_HIGH_QUALITY.
-------------------------
Q9) My output device support grey-scale. Should I use it?
A9) Yes for the best quality and end-user experience you should use grey-scale whenever possible.
-------------------------
Q10) How do I turn the T2K run-time hinting on or off?
A10) It is enabled by turning on the T2K_GRID_FIT bit in the 6th input parameterto T2K_RenderGlyph called cmd.
	 It is disabled by turning off the T2K_GRID_FIT bit in the 6th input parameterto T2K_RenderGlyph called cmd.
-------------------------
Q11) When should the T2K run-time hinting be on or off?
A11) For monochrome output your probably mostly want to turn it on.
	For a high quality display device such as a computer monitor you should probably turn it on.
	For a device such as a TV monitor you should turn it off.
-------------------------
Q12) I am using an interlacing TV as the output device. How do I make it look good?
A12) First turn off grid-fitting to get an image with less sharp transitions. (This also speeds up T2K).
	Then turn on T2K_TV_MODE if you use integer metrics and do not use fractional positioning to improve the quality.
	Then you most likely also want to experiment with a simple filter to make the image
	more blurry. A simple 3*3 convolution is probably sufficient. You should
	probably "average" more in the y-direction than the x-direction to avoid the
	interlacing flicker. Alternatively your HW may have alrady have this built in.
-------------------------
Q13) A T2K call/method returned an error. What should the code do?
A13) T2K automatically deletes all of its objects when it hits an error.
	This means that all references to T2K objects become invalid, and can no
	longer be used.
-------------------------
Q14) I noticed that there are a lot of asserts in the code...Why?
A14) Asserts are in the code to detect/prevent programmer errors. The idea is that an
	assert should never happen in real life. They are only there to catch programmer errors.
	In a release build you need to turn off asserts in "CONFIG.H" to increase speed and
	to reduce the code size. However in debug builds please leave it on, to ensure that
	everything is working as intended.
-------------------------
Q15) How do I decide what mapping table (character set) to use in a TrueType or T2K font?
A15) Use Set_PlatformID( scaler, ID ), and Set_PlatformSpecificID( scaler, ID )
	To use the Unicode mapping used by Windows do the following:
	Set_PlatformID( scaler, 3 );
	Set_PlatformSpecificID( scaler, 1 );
	You can insert the code right after the NewT2K constructor.
-------------------------
Q16) Can you explain the second parameter called code to T2K_RenderGlyph?
A16) Yes, this normally specifies the character code for the character you wish to render.
	However if you wish to use the glyph index instead then set the T2K_CODE_IS_GINDEX
	bit in the 6th input parameter to T2K_RenderGlyph called cmd. The glyph index is
	simply a number from 0 to N-1, assuming the font contains N glyphs.
	(N = T2K_GetNumGlyphsInFont( scaler );)
-------------------------
Q17) Does the outline winding direction matter in T2K?
A17) Yes Postscript outlines should use the correct winding direction and
	TrueType and T2K outlines also need to use the correct winding direction
	which is actually the opposite of the Postscript direction. It matters because
	the run-time-hinting process use this information to figure out where the
	black and white areas are. For TrueType and T2K the direction should be such
	that if you follow a contour in the direction of increasing point numbers
	then the black(inside) area should be on your right.
-------------------------
Q18) I need my fonts to be as small as possible. What should I do?
A18) You need to contact Type Solutions to have them translated to the T2K format or to apply
	font compression.
-------------------------
Q19) Can you explain ALGORITHMIC_STYLES in config.h?
A19) Yes it enables algorithmic styling.
	The 6th parameter to FF_New_sfntClass(); T2K_AlgStyleDescriptor *styling
	is normally set to NULL, but if ALGORITHMIC_STYLES is enabled you can set
	it equal to an algoritmic style descriptor. Here is an example using the
	algorithmic bolding provided by T2K.
		style.StyleFunc			=	tsi_SHAPET_BOLD_GLYPH;
		style.StyleMetricsFunc	=	tsi_SHAPET_BOLD_METRICS;
		style.params[0]			=	5L << 14;
		sfnt0 = FF_New_sfntClass( mem, fontType, 0, in, NULL, &style, &errCode );
	You can also write your own outline based style modifications and use them instead
	of the algorithmic bolding provided by T2K. Just model them after the Type Solutions
	code for algoritmic bolding in "SHAPET.c".
-------------------------
Q20) What is the story with USE_NON_ZERO_WINDING_RULE in config.h?
A20) The recommended setting is to leave it on.  This determines what
	kind of fill rule the T2K scan-converter will use. This enables
	a non-zero winding rule, otherwise the scan-converter will use an even-odd
	filling rule. For example the even-odd filling rule will turn an area
	where two strokes overlap (rare) into white, but the non zero winding
	rule will keep such areas black. For an embedded system where the fonts
	are well build and you do not have overlapping strokes you will get a
	small (proably less than 1%) speed-up by disabling this.
-------------------------
Q21) In the internal part of the options, there is an option called SAMPO_TESTING_T2K (!)
	which should be disabled. The only thing it does is to enable ENABLE_WRITE and ENABLE_PRINTF.
	But those two options are enabled unconditionally at the top of "dont touch" part. What is going on?
A21) :-) You should leave it off, since it is in the "dont touch" part.
	When T2K is built as a font engine T2K_SCALER is defined.(Not when built as a translator)
	ifdef T2K_SCALER
	actually does an  undef ENABLE_PRINTF and an undef ENABLE_WRITE
	Since the T2K font engine never does disk writes and does not use printf statements.
	However, when the code is undergoing testing at Type Solutions the
	T2K font engine may write to disk for logging purposes and use printf statements.
-------------------------
Q22) Are the functions used in the T2K_DOCUMENTATION_CODING_EXAMPLE part of t2k.h the only public APIs?
	Are there any other functions that might be useful to know?
A22) Yes, but the idea is that you should only use functions/methods visible in T2K.H.
	For instance T2K_MeasureTextInX() may be useful for quickly determining lengths of text string.
	If you find a need to use something else then let us know and if it makes sense
	we may bring out a public way to do it.
	Do not rely on any function/methods outside of T2K since they may change from release to release.
-------------------------
Q23) I found that when a string contains a space, T2K_RenderGlyph returns NULL baseAddr. Why is that?
	Do I have to check the existence of space characters and advance x position accordingly?
A23) There is no bitmap to draw! Makes sense :-).
	Dont check for space, etc. just check for baseAddr == NULL instead.
	In the future with T2KE check for ( baseARGB == NULL && baseAddr == NULL )
-------------------------
Q24) Are there functions for measuring widths and other metrics of strings
	(such as X11s XTextWidth, and XTextExtent)?
A24) I think the closest to XTextWidth is T2K_MeasureTextInX in T2K.H
	(It measures the linear un-hinted width, it can not measure the hinted width without actually
	rendering the characters).
	There is no equivalent to X11s XTExtExtent, since this sort of function typically would need
	to be implemented on top of the font-bit-map cache. T2K does not cache the output data,
	so T2K clients typically implement a cache on top of T2K so that the second time a character is
	requested it can come directly from the cache without invoking T2K. This sort of cache makes things
	go fast. String wide functions should be implemented so that they request information from the
	cache, to avoid T2K having to recompute everything several times.
	T2K also has two early experimental functions called T2K_GetIdealLineWidth(), T2K_LayoutString().
	They can help you to layout an entire line so that the total width is the ideal linear width, while
	still using run-time hinted individual characters and metrics. At least is attempts to do this
	by mostly putting the nonlinearities into the space characters between the words.
-------------------------
Q25) Can I edit T2K_BLACK_VALUE, and T2K_WHITE_VALUE so that I get a different range for the grey-scale?
A25) No, you should not edit anything in T2K.H. They are there so that you can put in an assert in your
	code so that you can automatically detect if they are ever changed by Type Solutions in the future.
-------------------------
Q26) What does T2K_TV_MODE do?
A26) It improves the results for situations where you do *not* use T2K_GRID_FIT (T2K hinting) and you do
	use gray-scale such as the TV-screen and you do use integer metrics.
	It compensates for the integralization of the advance width by adjusting the white sapce around the character
	*and* additionally it also ensures that we get left right symmetry in the gray-scale for simple symmetrical characters.
	If you use T2K_TV_MODE then turn off T2K_GRID_FIT.
	You should use T2K_TV_MODE when the following three conditions are true
	(1) You do not wish to use T2K_GRID_FIT (T2K hinting).
	(2) You are using gray-scale.
	(3) You are using integer metrics and not fractional positioning with fractional metrics. (Only one version of each character per size)
-------------------------
Q27) How do I get the type face name?
A27) You basically call T2K_SetNameString() (see below),
	at some point after you have called Set_PlatformID(), and Set_PlatformSpecificID().
	It sets the public fields nameString8 or nameString16 in the T2K object(structure).
	To use Microsoft Unicode mapping and names you can use:
	Set_PlatformID( scaler, 3 );
	Set_PlatformSpecificID( scaler, 1 );	/* 3,1 Picks Microsoft Unicode character mapping. */
	T2K_SetNameString( scaler, 0x0409, 4 );	/* Picks American English & the full font name */
-------------------------
Q28) How do I get native TrueType hint support in T2K?
A28) A: You need 2 additional .c and 2 .h files. (fnt.c/.h and t2ktt.c/.h)
	 B: You also need to #define ENABLE_NATIVE_TT_HINTS in config.h.
	 C: Then turn on T2K_NAT_GRID_FIT (T2K-native-grid-fitting) in the cmd parameter to T2K_RenderGlyph();
-------------------------
Q29) How do I slant the the text (make algorithmic italics)?
A29) Set the transformation matrix this may:
		trans.t00 = ONE16Dot16 * size;
		trans.t01 = ONE16Dot16 * sin( italic_angle) * size;
		trans.t10 = 0;
		trans.t11 = ONE16Dot16 * size;

	before calling T2K_NewTransformation().
	Size is a number such as 16.
	italic_angle is a number such as 12.0 degrees. In this case ONE16Dot16 * sin( 12.0 ) would be 13626.
----------------------
Q30) I need the actual outline spline data. How do I get it?
A30) Turn on the T2K_RETURN_OUTLINES to the cmd parameter to T2K_RenderGlyph().
	This will set the public field glyph in T2K.
	/*** Begin outline data */
	GlyphClass *glyph;
	/*** End outline data */
	GlyphClass has public fields with the outline data.

	Here are the relevant fields in GlyphClass:
	short	curveType;		/* 2 for TrueType (2nd degree B-spline) outlines and 3 for Type 1 (3rd Degree Bezier) */
	short	contourCount;	/* number of contours in the character */
	short	pointCount;		/* number of points in the characters + 0 for the sidebearing points */
	int16	*sp;			/* sp[contourCount] Start points */
	int16	*ep;			/* ep[contourCount] End points */
	int16	*oox;			/* oox[pointCount] Unscaled Unhinted Points, add two extra points for lsb, and rsb */
	int16	*ooy;			/* ooy[pointCount] Unscaled Unhinted Points, set y to zero for the two extra points */
							/* Do NOT include the two extra points in sp[], ep[], contourCount */
							/* Do NOT include the two extra points in pointCount */
	uint8 *onCurve;			/* onCurve[pointCount] indicates if a point is on or off the curve, it should be true or false */

	F26Dot6 *x, *y;			/* The actual points in device coordinates. */

	The character is made out of 'contourCount' contours.
	The outline coordinates are stored in F26Dot6 format in the x and y arrays. (6 fractional bits)
	Each contour starts with the point number sp[contour], and ends with with point number ep[contour].
	sp[0] should typically be zero. The letter A typically has 2 contours, B has 3, C has 1 etc.
	The contours are self closing.
	Each point is either an "on" or "off" curve point.
	A third degree Bezier is  on, off, off, on.
	A 2nd degree parabola is on, off, on.
	So a particular point n is described by x[n], y[n], onCurve[n].
	Please note that 2nd degree B-spline allow many consequtive off curve points.
-------------------------
Q31) I do not suppose you have any sample code which actually goes
	through the process of getting and evaluating the outline data?
A31) To see how T2K breaks down the outlines into parabolas (or 3rd degree beziers) and straight lines you can look at:
	Make2ndDegreeEdgeList() for parabols and
	Make3rdDegreeEdgeList() for 3rd degree beziers inside T2KSC.c.

	Once you have a parabola (described by three points A,B,C) it is described in parametric form by
	(1-t)*(1-t)*A + 2 *t *(1-t)*B + t*t*C
	Once you have a 3rd degree Bezier (described by 4 points A,B,C,D) it is described in parametric form by
	(1-t)*(1-t)*(1-t)*A + 3*(1-t)*(1-t)*t*B + 3*(1-t)*t*t * C+ t*t*t * D

	In both cases t starts being equal to zero at point A and then it goes to one by the last point.
-------------------------
Q32) Can you explain the glyph specific metrics in more detail ?
A32) Here is a lower case letter "g" showing the meanings of glyph specific metrics.

        t2k->fTop26Dot6 (26.6) This is the vertical line below, from base line to the top of the bitmap.
         <----> t2k->fLeft26Dot6 (26.6)
           ^     ***********    ^ t2k->heigth (integer number of scanlines) (32.0)
           |   *             *  |
           |   *             *  |
           |   *             *  |
           |   *             *  |
           |   *             *  |
---------O v----************----|---O------------------
         ^                   *  |   ^
pen pos- |                   *  |   |- next pen position.
                             *  |
               *             *  |
                 ***********    v

               <------------->   t2k->width (integer number of pixels) (32.0)
          <------------------------->   t2k->xAdvanceWidth16Dot16 (16.16)

	So for horzontal text put the left top corner of the bitmap at
	[((x + 0x8000)>> 16) + (scaler->fLeft26Dot6 >> 6), ((y + 0x8000)>> 16) - (scaler->fTop26Dot6 >>6)]

	then advance the pen:
	 x += scaler->xAdvanceWidth16Dot16;
	 y += scaler->yAdvanceWidth16Dot16;

	and for vertical text put the left top corner of the bitmap at
	[((x + 0x8000)>> 16) + (scaler->vert_fLeft26Dot6 >> 6), ((y + 0x8000)>> 16) - (scaler->vert_fTop26Dot6 >>6)]
	then advance the pen:
	 x += scaler->vert_xAdvanceWidth16Dot16;
	 y += scaler->vert_yAdvanceWidth16Dot16;
-------------------------
Q33) How do I use my own memory allocator and deallocator with T2K?
A33) CONFIG.H allows you to remap allocation, reallocation and deletion to anything you want. See the 3 first defines.
-------------------------
Q34) What is the persistence of some of the different T2K data structures needs to be?
	In particular: Does the input stream need to be allocated for as long as the font is
	active and allocated?  I would like to be able to do this within the initialization stage:

	memHandler_ = tsi_NewMemHandler( &err );
	inStream = New_InputStream3( memHandler_, data, length, &err );
	font_ = New_sfntClass( memHandler_, fontType, inStream, NULL, &err );
	...
	scaler_ = NewT2K( font_->mem, font_, &err );
	...
	Delete_InputStream( inStream, &err );

	That is, I want to delete the input stream and continue to use the font.
	Is this feasible, or does the font continue to refer to the input
	stream even after the sfntClass and the T2K structures have been built?
A34) The various object have to be deleted in the reverse order of creation.
	This means that the InputStream object can only be deleted *after* you
	have deleted the T2K and sfntClass abject.
-------------------------
Q35) >- Does the transformation need to exist as an external (application-
	managed) structure after calling T2K_NewTransformation?  If not, I would
	like to be able to do this within the font initialization stage:
		trans_ = new T2K_TRANS_MATRIX;
		trans_->t00 = ONE16Dot16 * pointSize;
		trans_->t01 = 0;
		trans_->t10 = 0;
		trans_->t11 = ONE16Dot16 * pointSize;
		T2K_NewTransformation( scaler_, true, 72, 72, trans_, true, &err );
		delete trans_; ?
A35) The T2K_TRANS_MATRIX structure can be deleted right after T2K_NewTransformation().
-------------------------
Q36) Our application will typically have between three and a dozen
	fonts open and active at the same time. Am I correct to assume this is not
	going to cause any problems within T2K?
A36) This is OK. You should have one tsiMemObject per font.
	You can choose to keep multiple fonts open simultansously and you can also decide to have one or multiple T2K scalers simultaneously,
	or you could decide to only allow one font open at a time.
	You can also decide to either use memory based fonts when you create the InputStream class or you can choose to use disk based fonts.
	These choices are a tradeoff between memory use and speed.
-------------------------
Q37) I turn on the T2K_RETURN_OUTLINES bit flag to T2K_RenderGlyph and I am using the t2k->glyph structure.
	Unfortunately my code can only handle 3rd degree Bezieers. What can I do when t2k->glyph->curveType == 2?
A37) First we encourage you to see if your current code can handle the 2nd degree curves directly
	since they can be rendered quicker than 3rd degree curves.
	If not, then this is how you go between them:
	(1) First we need to find all straight lines and parabolas:
		The function Make2ndDegreeEdgeList() function from T2KSC.c shows how that is done:
	(2) Now each Parabola (== 2nd degree Bezieer) is described by the points A,B,C.
		Each 3rd degree Bezieer is described by points P1,P2,P3,P4.

		To map points [A,B,C] to [P1,P2,P3,P4] do this:
			P1 = A;
			P2 = (2B + A)/3;
			P3 = (2B + C)/3;
			P4 = C;
-------------------------
Q38) What should I do if T2K returns an error?
A38) Once you get an error from T2K it frees up ALL memory.
	This means that you need to set all references to T2K to NULL and not call any T2K delete routines etc.
	Basically you have to start from the beginning again as if T2K never existed when you get an error.
-------------------------
Q39) Now, if an error is encountered, is it just that particuliar
	T2K that must be "restarted", or all the T2K objects?
A39) Not all T2K objects just all objects that shared the same tsiMemObject have to be restarted.
	You should have one tsiMemObject per font.
-------------------------
Q40) How do I make a colored bordered character?
A40) Just invoke invoked T2K_CreateBorderedCharacter (in T2KEXTRA.c) right after T2K_RenderGlyph().
	After this you can find the 32 bit colored bordred character in t2kscaler->baseARGB. The format is ARGB, 8 bits each.
-------------------------
Q41) How do I drive LCD displays?
A41) There are two categories of LCD modes that you can use. Bitstream recommends you use the new one to get the best result.

	(I) For the old LCD mode:
		Here are step by step instructions:

		A: Enable the ENABLE_LCD_OPTION in config.h.
		B: Use FF_NewColorTable to get the RGB colors for LCD display. These colors
			will be indexed by any bitmap produced by T2K. If your platform is using a Color
			Lookup Table, you will need to set these colors in that table.
			This is how you extract the actual RGB colors from the T2K color table:

			ff_ColorTableType *pColorTable;

			/* for black text on white Set Rb = Gb = Bb = 0xff, and Rf = Gf = Bf = 0. */
			pColorTable = FF_NewColorTable( mem, Rb, Gb, Bb, Rf, Gf, Bf );

			/* For all the indeces in the bitmap you get the color by doing this. */
			/* pColorTable->N will contain # elements in the array */
			/* pColorTable->ARGB[0] contains the first ARGB value */
			ARGB = pColorTable->ARGB[ byte index from the bitmap ];
			B = (ARGB & 0xff); ARGB >>= 8;
			G = (ARGB & 0xff); ARGB >>= 8;
			R = (ARGB & 0xff);

			/* When done free up the color-table, but please do not call this per-character for speed reasons. */
			FF_DeleteColorTable( mem, pColorTable);

		C: Do not invoke either FF_SetBitRange255() or FF_SetRemapTable(). If you need to shift
			the range, we recommend using a filter function.
		D: When you invoke T2K_NewTransformation() set the xRes to 3 times the yRes, since
			if you look close at the screen there are 3 times as many colored pixels in
			the x direction as there are in the y direction. This tells T2K we have a non-square
			aspect ratio where the x resolution is 3 times higher than the y resolution.
		E: Then set T2K_LCD_MODE_4 in the cmd parameter and GREY_SCALE_BITMAP_HIGH_QUALITY
			in the greyScalelevel paramter to the function T2K_RenderGlyph().
		F: You now have an indexed color bitmap. When you draw the bitmap you need to take into
			account that the bitmap contains indices for the colored pixels.

	(II) For the new LCD mode:
		Here are step by step instructions:

		A: Enable the ENABLE_EXTENDED_LCD_OPTION in config.h
		B: Use FF_NewColorTable to get the RGB colors for LCD display. These colors
			will be indexed by any bitmap produced by T2K. If your platform is using a Color
			Lookup Table, you will need to set these colors in that table.
			This is how you extract the actual RGB colors from the T2K color table:

			ff_ColorTableType *pColorTable;

			/* for black text on white Set Rb = Gb = Bb = 0xff, and Rf = Gf = Bf = 0. */
			pColorTable = FF_NewColorTable( mem, Rb, Gb, Bb, Rf, Gf, Bf );

			/* For all the indeces in the bitmap you get the color by doing this. */
			/* pColorTable->N will contain # elements in the array */
			/* pColorTable->ARGB[0] contains the first ARGB value */
			ARGB = pColorTable->ARGB[ byte index from the bitmap ];
			B = (ARGB & 0xff); ARGB >>= 8;
			G = (ARGB & 0xff); ARGB >>= 8;
			R = (ARGB & 0xff);

			/* When done free up the color-table, but please do not call this per-character for speed reasons. */
			FF_DeleteColorTable( mem, pColorTable);

		C: Do not invoke either FF_SetBitRange255() or FF_SetRemapTable(). If you need to shift
			the range, we recommend using a filter function.
		D: There are four LCD modes in this new LCD category. They are horizontal left-to-right RGB,
			horizontal left-to-right BGR ,vertical top-to-down RGB and vertical Top-to-down BGR.
			So turn on the approriate bitflag in cmd. For example, if you need horizontal left-to-right RGB mode,
			set T2K_EXT_LCD_H_RGB in the cmd parameter. Set GREY_SCALE_BITMAP_HIGH_QUALITY in the greyScalelevel
			paramter to the function T2K_RenderGlyph().
		E: You now have an indexed color bitmap. When you draw the bitmap you need to take into
			account that the bitmap contains indices for the colored pixels.
		F: Unlike the old LCD mode, you do NOT have to set the xRes to 3 times in the T2K_NewTransformation().
-------------------------
Q42) What is the difference between T2K_TV_MODE_2 and T2K_TV_MODE, and also between T2K_LCD_MODE and T2K_LCD_MODE_2?
A42) The _2 modifier activates a special light-weight y hint strategy which improves the quality. It for instance makes the
	antialiased bitmap pattern on top and bottom of an 'o' symmetrical.
	It is recommended for both TV and LCD output for the best quality.
	The regular LCD and TV modes already also make such characters left-right symmetrical for optimal quality.
	For best quality, T2K_LCD_MODE_4 is recommended because it employs native hints.
-------------------------
Q43) What is a tsiMemObject object, what does it do?
A43) It is an object that handles all memory allocation, deallocation and reallocation.
	The reason we have it done by one object instead of direct calls to the OS is that
	the tsiMemObject object does a lot of error checking. This creates a more stable product.
	For instance it puts special markers both before and after allocated memory so that we
	can detect any attemps to write outside the allocated memory. It also detecs any memory
	leaks and attempts to free no-pointers or or already freed memory and other memory errors.
	Basically the tsiMemObject provides a solid foundations for the product.
-------------------------
Q44) Why do we need one tsiMemObject per font?
A44) We could have shared this. But it seems we get a slight performance advantage using only one per font.
	The current implementation of tsiMemObject also has a maximum limit on the number of pointers it can allocate.
-------------------------
Q45) What is a InputStream object, what does it do?
A45) The InputStream object provides a level of abstraction for the core. Basically
	the InputStream object exposes certain methods that T2K uses to access the data.
	This means that T2K does not need to know if the data is in memory, on the disk, or a across a network, etc.
	This provides a cleaner design. The InputStream object also checks for out-of bounds read attempts.
	This error checking together with the nice abstraction InputStream provides produces a more solid and robust design
	and therefore a better product.
-------------------------
Q46) What does a sfntClass do?
A46) The sfntClass is an internal class that represents a font. It is shared by all supported font formats.
-------------------------
Q47) What is a T2K class, what does it do?
A47) The T2K object represents an instance of the font scaler. Main task for the fonts scaler is to produce
	good looking bitmap images for characters at differnt sizes and tranformations like rotation.
-------------------------
Q48) T2K_NewTransformation transform which item to what?
A48) T2K_NewTransformation is a method that informs the T2K object about the current transformation and size is.
-------------------------
Q49) What does T2K_RenderGlyph() do?
A49) It produces the bitmap image that we want.
-------------------------
Q50) I am using one of the Font Fusion stroke fonts and the output is too light! Can you make a heavier/bolder font?
A50) The good news is that that a Font Fusion stroke font has variable weight!!!
	This is one of the benefits of our stroke fonts, this means that a single
	font can have many many different looks :-)

	You are probably just using the default weight which is pretty light.
	The default is at 0.5 in 16.16 space.
	The weight is variable between 0.0 and 1.0 in 16.16 space.

	For instance try this:
	if ( T2K_GetNumAxes( scaler ) == 1 ) {
		T2K_SetCoordinate( scaler, 0, 0x10000*7/10 ); /* instead of default 0x10000/2 */
	}
	You can do this setting right after T2K_NewTransformation();

	You can tune the number to whatever looks best in your circumstance.
-------------------------
Q51) I am still confused about anti-aliasing and how to blend letters with a random background image.
A51) Instead of setting greyScaleLevel to the function T2K_RenderGlyph to
	BLACK_AND_WHITE_BITMAP  set it to GREY_SCALE_BITMAP_MEDIUM_QUALITY
	and FontFusion will return a gray-scale bitmap. This is the same as an alpha mask.

	Think of an alpha value and a bitmap filled with alpha values (an alpha mask)
	conceptually as a partially transparent glass window. Also think of the
	alpha value as conceptually going between 0.0 (fully transparent) to
	1.0 (fully opaque).

	When the alpha value is 0.0 you see everything behind the window (the background),
		but not the foreground.
	When the alpha value is 1.0 you only see the foreground color (or image).
	When the alpha value is 0.5 you see a blend consisting of 50% the background and 50% the foreground.
	To perfectly blend the foreground and background you need to pixel by
		pixel blend the background pixel values and foreground pixel values
		according to this linear formula

	newPixelColor = alpha*foregoundPixelColor + (1.0-alpha) * backgroundPixelColor

	When FontFusion operates in its normal grayscale mode then a value of
	T2K_BLACK_VALUE (126) in the alphamask returned by FontFusion corresponds
	to alpha == 1.0, and 0 corresponds to alpha == 0.
	Q&A6 also contains pseudo code that illustrates this.
-------------------------
Q52) What next?
A52) Go try the code. Good Luck! :-)
